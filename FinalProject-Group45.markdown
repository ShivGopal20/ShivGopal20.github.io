# Are holidays in San Francisco becoming better?
**Authors:** Rohan Khalid and Shiv Gopal

San Francisco is a city known for many things. This includes The Golden Gate Bridge, the architecture and its hilly terrain. Even though San Francisco is known for its many good qualities, it is also known for crime. The crime happens all year round, but especially at a time when most people are focused on giving, while some people are focused on taking. We are, of course, talking about the holiday season, when larceny and theft are very popular because people leave many of their possessions alone when spending time with their friends and family. Recently, there has been discussion about a decline in larceny/theft during the holiday season. We will now examine whether this is merely political rhetoric or if there is truth to these claims.

### Larcency theft in the holiday season
We can look at the annually reported incidents to get a brief overview of larceny theft in San Francisco. As seen in the figure below, there have been very high numbers of larceny theft incidents from November 20th to December 31st throughout the years until 2023. 2020 is an outlier likely due to social distancing and people being more home during the pandemic, which decreased many types of crime, including larceny theft. It is however clear that the number of larcency incidents suddenly fell in 2023. It seems to be almost halved than the priod year. This is obviosly good news for the residents of San Fransisco, but how did this sudden change happen?

The government of San Fransico might have an answer to this. The SF gov has stated the following on the 4th of January 2024:
"*Local law enforcement has been conducting ongoing strategic operations to disrupt car break-ins and retail theft citywide, and to heighten safety efforts in shopping areas during the holidays.*"
"*The reductions in larceny theft reached lows not seen in the last five years, including during the pandemic.*"

These statements by the city of SF make sense with our current overall assessment in terms of explaining the fall in larceny theft in the holiday season of 2023. Based on this we know that the talks about a decrease in larcency theft seems to be true in the overall picture, and that there has been an active political and police-oriented approach which might have resulted in this improvement.

### What is really going on with Larcency Theft inside SF?
In order to get a better and deeper understanding of this decrease we need to dig deeper. We can do this by looking at larcency theft from a district perspecive in the interactive map below. It is clear that the improvement mentioned before is quite visible for almost all districts. However the District: "Central" seems to be quite similar throughout the years.

Even though it might seem like Central still has the same amount of incidents throughout the years, this is far from the case which can be seen by holding the mouse over the district and looking at the numbers of incidents throughout the years. This can also be seen from another figure showing the same thing but in another way. In the interactive figure below we can see that in fact all districts are significantly lower in terms of number of larcency theft incidents, even in Central. This seems to be rather good news.

The questions is wether or not the reason for this improvement is the new approach by the SF Gov. A way to check this is to do annual comparisons from 2018 to 2023, without focusing on holidays. This will show us if there generally just has been less larcency theft in 2023 compared to other years or if it really is just the holiday season which have changed due to the increased effort by the goverment. In the interactive figure below we can in fact see that 2023 seems a bit better than the previous year but the difference is not even close to the improvement in the holiday period between 2022 and 2023. This shows that the improved effort in the holiday season by the SF Goverment, is likely the reason for the decrease in 2023.

### Is it only larcency theft?
If the improved effort has decreased larcency theft in SF, then what about other similar crimes? In order to look more into that we have made another interactive figure below over different types of similar crimes. Here it is clear that in terms of the holiday season in 2023, there has been significant improvements in almost all the crime types from 2022 to 2023, excect for robbery. The further shows that the effort of the SF goverment and law enforcement is doing something good for the city.

As earlier we have made an annual interactive figure, and this showcases a small difference so this further showcases that it is really the effort in the holiday season which has worked well and been a big reason for the change. This can be seen because the change from 2022 to 2023, when we look at the whole year is a lot smaller than the change seen in terms of the holiday season between 2022 and 2023.

### Conclusion
Overall, it seems like the effort by the SF government has been a success. This can be seen because we know the effort took place in the holiday season in 2023, and this time period is an outliner in the data regarding the low amount of larceny theft and similar crimes. This improvement is clear across districts as well. We can however see that the improvement between 2022 and 2023, without looking at the holiday season, is less compared to the improvement in the holiday season. This shows that it would be a good idea for the city to make similar efforts throughout the year to combat crime and improve the city.
