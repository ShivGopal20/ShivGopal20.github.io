# Are holidays in San Francisco becoming better?
**Authors:** Rohan Khalid and Shiv Gopal

San Francisco is a city known for many things. This includes The Golden Gate Bridge, the architecture and its hilly terrain. Even though San Francisco is known for its many good qualities, it is also known for crime. The crime happens all year round, but especially at a time when most people are focused on giving, while some people are focused on taking. We are, of course, talking about the holiday season, when larceny and theft are very popular because people leave many of their possessions alone when spending time with their friends and family. Recently, there has been discussion about a decline in larceny/theft during the holiday season. We will now examine whether this is merely political rhetoric or if there is truth to these claims.

### Larcency theft in the holiday season
We can look at the annually reported incidents to get a brief overview of larceny theft in San Francisco. As seen in the figure below, there have been very high numbers of larceny theft incidents from November 20th to December 31st throughout the years until 2023. 2020 is an outlier due to social distancing and people being more home, which decreased many types of crime, including larceny theft. It is clear that the number of incidents suddenly fell in 2023. It seems to be almost halved. This is good, but how did this happen?

The government of San Fransico has an answer to this. The SF gov has stated the following on the 4th of January 2024:
"*Local law enforcement has been conducting ongoing strategic operations to disrupt car break-ins and retail theft citywide, and to heighten safety efforts in shopping areas during the holidays.*"
"*The reductions in larceny theft reached lows not seen in the last five years, including during the pandemic.*"

This makes sense with our current overall assessment in terms of explaining the fall in larceny theft in the holiday season of 2023 and our assessment regarding 2020. So based on this we know that the talks about a decrease in larcency theft seems to be true in the overall picture.

### What is really going on with Larcency Theft inside SF?
In order to get a better understanding of this decrease we need to dig deeper. We can do this by looking at larcency theft from a district perspecive. In the interactive map below. Here it is clear that the pattern mentioned before is quite clear for almost districts with the decrease in 2020 and 2023. However the District: "Central" seems to be quite similar throughout the years.

Even though it might seem like Central still has the same amount of incidents, this is far from the case which can be seen from this figure showing the same thing but in another way. In the interactive figure below we can see that in fact all districts are significantly lower in terms of number of larcency and theft incidents, even central. This seems to be rather good news.

The questions is wether or not the reasoning for this the new approach my the SF Gov. A way to check this is to do annual comparisons from 2018 to 2023, without focusing on holidays. This will show us if there generally just has been less larcency theft in 2023 compared to other years or if it really is the holiday season which has changed do to the increased effort by the goverment. In the interactive figure below we can in fact see that 2023 seems a bit better than the previous year but the difference is not even close to the improvement in the holiday period. This shows that it potentially could be the improved effort in the holiday time by the SF Goverment which have cause the decrease in 2023.
