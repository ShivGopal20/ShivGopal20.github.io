San Francisco is a city known for many things. This includes The Golden Gate Bridge, the architecture and its hilly terrain. Even though San Francisco is known for its many good qualities, it is also known for crime. The crime happens all year round, but especially at a time when most people are focused on giving, while some people are focused on taking. We are talking about the holiday season when larceny theft are very popular because people leave many possessions alone when spending time with their friends and family. Recently, there has been discussion about a decline in larceny theft during the holiday season. We will now examine whether this is merely political rhetoric or if there is truth to these claims.

### Larcency theft in the holiday season
We can look at the annually reported incidents for a brief overview of larceny theft in San Francisco. As seen in the figure below, there have been very high numbers of larceny theft incidents from November 20th to December 31st throughout the years until 2023. 2020 is an outlier, likely due to social distancing and people being more home during the pandemic, which decreased many types of crime, including larceny theft. It is, however, clear that the number of larceny incidents suddenly fell in 2023. It is almost halved than the prior year. This is good news for the residents of San Fransisco, but how did this sudden change happen?

The government of San Fransico might have an answer to this. The SF gov has stated the following on January 4th 2024:
"*Local law enforcement has been conducting ongoing strategic operations to disrupt car break-ins and retail theft citywide, and to heighten safety efforts in shopping areas during the holidays.*"
"*The reductions in larceny theft reached lows not seen in the last five years, including during the pandemic.*"

The statements by the city of San Francisco align with our overall assessment, providing a possible explanation for the decline in larceny theft during the 2023 holiday season. This confirms that the discussions about a decrease in larceny theft are indeed true, and that the city's active political and increased police approach has probably contributed to this improvement. This is very good news for the residents of San Francisco, underscoring the importance of maintaining these efforts to ensure their safety and security.

### What is really going on with Larcency Theft inside SF?
We need to dig deeper to understand this decrease better. We can do this by looking at larceny theft from a district perspective, as shown on the interactive map below. The improvement mentioned before is quite visible for almost all districts. However, the District "Central" seems to have remained relatively similar throughout the years.

Even though it might seem like Central still has the same number of incidents throughout the years, this is far from the case seen by holding the mouse over the District and looking at the numbers of incidents throughout the years. This can also be seen from another figure showing the same thing but in another way. The interactive figure below shows that all districts are significantly lower in terms of several larceny theft incidents, even in Central. This is rather good news.

The question is whether or not the reason for this improvement is the new approach by the SF Gov. A way to check this is to do annual comparisons from 2018 to 2023 without focusing on holidays. This will show us if there has been less larceny theft in 2023 compared to other years or if it is just the holiday season, which has changed due to the increased effort by the government. The interactive figure below shows that 2023 seems better than the previous year, but the difference is not even close to the improvement in the holiday period between 2022 and 2023. This shows that the improved effort in the holiday season by the SF government is likely the reason for the decrease in 2023.

### Is it only larcency theft?
If the improved effort has decreased larceny theft in SF, what about other similar crimes? To look more into that, we have made another interactive figure below showing different types of similar crimes. Here, it is clear that in terms of the holiday season in 2023, there have been significant improvements in almost all the crime types from 2022 to 2023, except for robbery. This further shows that the effort of the SF government and law enforcement is doing something good for the city.

As mentioned earlier, we have created an annual interactive figure, which shows a small difference. This further underscores shows effectiveness of the holiday season efforts, which have proven to be a significant factor in the positive change. This can be seen in the comparison between the whole year of 2022 and 2023, where the change is relatively smaller than the change seen during the holiday season of 2022 and 2023. This good change should motivate the government to continue such initiatives.

### Conclusion
Overall, it seems like the effort by the SF government has been a success. This can be seen because we know the effort took place in the holiday season in 2023, and this time period is an outliner in the data regarding the low amount of larceny theft and similar crimes. This improvement is clear across districts as well. We can however see that the improvement between 2022 and 2023, without looking at the holiday season, is less compared to the improvement in the holiday season. This shows that it would be a good idea for the city to make similar efforts throughout the year to combat crime and improve the city.
